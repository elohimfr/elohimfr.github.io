I am a PhD candidate in mathematics working on network science. My advisor is Professor Naoki Masuda at the State University of New York at Buffalo. My research focus is complex systems under the scope of network science and statistical physics, using a blend of agent-based simulations and analitical methods. My main interest has been the study of emergent/collective behaviors using temporal networks, stochastic processes on networks, spreading dynamics, and random walks. Throughout my academic life, my projects involved different topics including neuroscience, immune systems, social networks, human dynamics, and opinion dynamics. In my last projects, I have focused on temporal networks and studied human face-to-face communication, and am currently investigating the temporal effects on opinion dynamics.
