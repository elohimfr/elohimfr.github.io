I am a PhD candidate in mathematics working on network science. My advisor is Professor Naoki Masuda at the State University of New York at Buffalo. I focus on modeling real systems, analytically and computationally, using network science and statistical physics tools such as temporal networks, stochastic processes on networks, spreading dynamics, and random walks, to name a few. Throughout my academic life, my projects involved different topics including neuroscience, immune systems, human dynamics, and opinion dynamics. In my last projects, I have focused on temporal networks and studied human face-to-face communication, and am currently investigating the temporal effects on opinion dynamics.
